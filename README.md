# Section visualizer - WIP

The section visualizer is a Python script developed for Rhino using the [RhinoScriptSyntax](https://github.com/mcneel/rhinoscriptsyntax) library. It automatically generates a sequence of axonometric and flat section views highlighting the sections curves extracted from a Rhino 3D model.

The development of this script arises from the need of quickly and efficiently generating an image or animation that easily explains and exposes the complex internal geometries of a 3D part to clients unfamiliar with 3D modeling tools.

+ Plane and UV direction selector.
+ Viewport settings standardization.
+ Section line width and color editor.
+ Photoshop script to automate gif creation.
+ Visualizing GUI to allow sliding through images and exporting animations.
