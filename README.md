# Section visualizer - WIP

The section visualizer is a Python script developed for Rhino using the [RhinoScriptSyntax](https://github.com/mcneel/rhinoscriptsyntax) library. It automaticaly generates a sequence of axonometric and flat section views highlighting the sections curves extracted from a Rhino 3D model. 

The development of this script arises from the need of quickly and efficiently generating an image or animation that easily explains and exposess the complex internal geometries of a 3D part to customers who are not familiar with 3D modeling tools.
